# Not And to Something

These are my solutions to a fantastic project that I won't name (when I had the name here people used my answers to cheat D:)

This project contains the complete source code for an 80s style simple computer, all the way from simple gates to a CPU. It also has a compiler for a high level Java-esque language that can be compiled and run on the virtual computer.
